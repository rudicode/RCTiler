Feature Ideas

- Add shortcut keys to make a window active. eg. Meta+Alt+Num+3 makes Lower Right window
active. If there is more than one window in the area then cycle through them.
  - It may be interesting to assign each window a zone number when it is originaly placed into
  that zone. That way even if the window is moved by other means it will still cycle through.
  - Need a shortcut to remove a window from a zone.
  - When a window that was assigne a zone is moved to center with Meta+Num+5 there can be a shortcut
    to move it back to its assigned zone. "Send back" function.
    Landscape -> Portrait -> Zone (if avaliable).
